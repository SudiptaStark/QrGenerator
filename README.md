## üöÄ Features

  * **Generate Instantly:** Create a QR code from any text or URL.
  * **Custom Sizing:** Select your QR code size, from a tiny 100x100 to a massive 1000x1000.
  * **Custom Colors:** Use the color picker to match your brand or style.
  * **Built-in Safety:** The app includes an **automatic contrast checker**. If you pick a color that's too light (like "invisible yellow"), it will default to black to ensure the QR code is *always* scannable.
  * **Instant Download:** Save your QR code as a `QR_Code.png` file with one click.
  * **Fully Responsive:** Looks and works great on both desktop and mobile.

## üíª Tech Stack

This project is built with simple, powerful, no-framework technologies:

  * **HTML5:** For the core structure.
  * **CSS3:** For all the custom styling (you'll need to add your `style.css` to the repo\!).
  * **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** For all the logic, event handling, and DOM manipulation.
  * **[qrcode.js](https://github.com/davidshimjs/qrcodejs):** The excellent, lightweight library that does the heavy lifting of generating the QR code.

## üèÉ How to Run Locally

Want to mess with the code? It's easy.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SudiptaStark/QrGenerator
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the folder:**

    ```bash
    cd QrGenerator
    ```

3.  **Open the file:**
    Just double-click the `index.html` file to open it directly in your favorite browser. No servers or dependencies are needed.

## üîÆ Possible Future Improvements

  * Allow uploading a logo to be placed in the center of the QR code.
  * Add more QR code types (e.g., WiFi credentials, vCard, Calendar event).
  * Give a *visual warning* about low contrast instead of just an `alert()`.
  * Generate the QR code live as the user types, not just on button-click.
